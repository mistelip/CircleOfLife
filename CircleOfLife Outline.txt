#Rules
Every Round:
if dead change to becomeID
lifespan -= 1;
	if == 0 --> change to becomeID
	
else	
For each Animal get 8-neighborhood:
	includes Pray	
		--> Change 1 Pray to Nothing//Can only eat one
		--> Add +1 to stomach
	
	includes A AND (stomach,A.stomach >= minFoodToRep) AND includes N
		--> change N to A with A.stomach = ave of the two.
		--> stomach = -1 for both A
		
		
		
Addition:
	Probablility that animal gets caught
	int MaxStomach
