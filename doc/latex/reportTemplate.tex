\section{Abstract}
In the film "Lion King" from Disney the main character's father explains to his son the concept of what he calls "the circle of life" and how all animals in the food chain hierarchy are needed in order for every species to survive. He abstracts the concept by explaining that lions become grass after they die. This grass is eaten by the antelopes, which are again eaten by the lions to complete the circle. We wanted to see if this concept is sound and said three organisms are able to survive within cellular automaton simulation.

\section{Individual contributions}
Patrick was responsible for the model, the parameters and the implementation in Matlab thereof. Ruben polished single aspects of the simulation and was responsible for the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore Ruben was responsible for the inclusion of the Lotka Volterra equation and finding papers thereof.

\section{Introduction and Motivations}
%Question 1: Is it possible to create a stable system? Yes
%Question 2: Is it possible for the system to remain stable if we were to remove one of the organisms? NO, Lotka Volterra: YES
Having a clear food chain hierarchy defined by the given "circle of life", we were not only interested in whether it is possible to create a stable system, but also which parameters effect the system in what way. Changing a minor parameter, for example how fast animals are able to reproduce or how hungry they are could have a major effect on the balance. Is it possible for the system to remain stable if we were to remove one of the organisms? To the end of the mentioned film "Lion King" the balance is destroyed when the lions start disrespecting the circle of life by overfeeding. Our model should be able to reproduce this effect when making the simulated lions "very hungry".
%Question 3: Do the two models, the Lotka-Volterra model and our model match in the sense, that they show the same simulation results? YES, except when removing lions
A very popular way of modeling the dynamics in populations is to use the Lotka-Volterra equations, \cite{lotkaVolterra}. Since we are using this model as a reference to our model, one of our fundamental research questions is whether it is possible to adjust our model to show similar results as the Lotka-Volterra model.

\section{Description of the Model}
\subsection{States}
Starting with Conway's Game of Life \cite{gameOfLife} a cell should not only have two states (active or inactive) it should now have the following four states representing all organisms:

\begin{description}
  \item[Nothing or Inactive (Black)] \hfill \\
	This represents a dead land cell where no living organism is located
  \item[Grass (Green)] \hfill \\
	This represents a living grass organism
  \item[Antelope (Brown)]  \hfill \\
	This represents a living antelope organism
  \item[Lion (Red)] 
   \hfill \\This represents a living lion organism
\end{description}

\subsection{Attributes}
Furthermore each of the four cell types must have parameterizable attributes in order for the extended rules to work. 
Table \ref{tab:Properties} lists all attributes and describes their meaning.

\subsection{Protocol per Timestep}
Once we have generated an initial map with random cells we start the time process. This means for an unlimited amount of time steps every cell gets called in random order and completes the protocol. This protocol is very similar to the rules in Conway's Game of Life but has various extensions in order to simulate the behavior of nature. The following is detailed description of what each cell processes in one time-step. Figure \ref{fig:protocol} can visualizes this process further.

\thispagestyle{empty}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=0.33]{images/DayProtocol.png}
\caption{Protocol for each time-step}
\label{fig:protocol}
\end{figure}


\newcounter{protocolCounter}
\setcounter{protocolCounter}{1}
\subsubsection{(\arabic{protocolCounter}) Initial check} 
Here we check whether the {\it Alive} attribute is still set to 1. If it is set to 0 it means at least one predator cell has taken a bite of the current organism in this time-step.  This corresponds to a predator killing its prey in nature. If the the current cell is declared as dead it cannot (naturally) do anything anymore. We thus skip the protocol from here on and initiate the protocol on a next cell. We do not remove the organism yet, since more predators may be within the neighborhood and feed on this organism.
\\We furthermore check whether the current cell is an offspring ({\it IsOffspring} $== 1$). This would mean 2 other cells of the same type have generated this cell in this time-step. A newly born cell is also unable to do anything and we therefore would skip the rest of the protocol from here on. In nature, a newly born animal is able to neither reproduce nor hunt on directly. We are aware that there are animals who are able to hunt directly "out of the shell" (such as crocodiles), but we are dealing with antelopes and lions in our simulation which do not posses such skills. In addition, this attribute prevents the creation of a chain of an organism in one step. For example: Two lions produce an offspring in an empty field next to them. The offspring could then be able to reproduce with one of its parents in a cell next to it. Hyperpolating this will result in a chain of lions in only one time-step.

\addtocounter{protocolCounter}{1}
\subsubsection{(\arabic{protocolCounter}) Livability Check} 
We now subtract what we have in the stomach by the number defined in the digestion attribute. If this causes a negative number in the stomach the organism has died of hunger and is instantly replaced by the type defined in its "Becomes" attribute. Furthermore we generate a random number. If this number is smaller than the death probability attribute the organism has died of age. As having died of hunger the organism is instantly replaced by the type defined in its "Becomes" attribute.\\
If the organism has died we skip the rest of the protocol and move on to the next cell. If the organism is still alive we can move on to the next protocol step. From here on we consider the neighborhood around the cell and act accordingly. The neighborhood is further described in section \ref{sec:neighbourhood}.
\addtocounter{protocolCounter}{1}
\subsubsection{(\arabic{protocolCounter}) Found Prey}
If we find an organism within the neighborhood who's type matches the type which was set in the current cell's PreyType attribute we have found food. We check whether out pray still has {\it fatness} left by checking its fatness attribute. An organism can only feed a fixed amount of predators. This amount is stored in the fatness attribute. The attribute is used to limit the number of predators who can eat this organism. Setting it to 1 means only one predator is able to feed himself before the prey becomes inedible. This corresponds to antelopes or grass only being able to fill the stomach of a certain amount of lions or antelopes respectively.\\
If the organism we encountered still has fatness larger than 0 we make sure the {\it Alive} attribute is set to 0 to incapacitate it. If this was not the case before we furthermore add the organism to a "deathlist". This list is used to keep track of all eaten organisms and after each time-step all organisms on the deathlist are removed (i.e become Nothing). 

\addtocounter{protocolCounter}{1}
\subsubsection{(\arabic{protocolCounter}) Found Mate}
If we find an organism who's type is equal to the current organisms type we check if it is possible to mate with it. This is done by ensuring the neighbor organism is alive ({\it Alive} attribute == 1) and that it has a high enough {\it Stomach} attribute in order to reproduce. I.e. the {\it Stomach} attribute must be equal or higher to the amount of the {\it MinStomachRep} attribute. Furthermore we ensure that the neighboring organism is not an offspring since a freshly born organism is unable to reproduce. Again, we are aware that there exist animals that are able to reproduce within the first day they are born (i.e. a mayfly XXXXCITEXXXX), but Antelopes and lions are not amongst those. If all these conditions are met the neighboring animal is set as a potential mate. An organism can only have one potential mate per timestep in order to keep a realistic reproduction rate.

\addtocounter{protocolCounter}{1}
\subsubsection{(\arabic{protocolCounter}) Found Mating Location}
If we find either a Grass or a Nothing cell in the surrounding neighborhood we mark it as a potential mating location. A Nothing cell receives higher priority in order to not replace potential food for the antelopes. 


\addtocounter{protocolCounter}{1}
\subsubsection{(\arabic{protocolCounter}) Reproduce}
\label{tab:reproduction}
Once we have processed all the cells in the neighborhood we now survey the outcome of the mating situation. If there we have a potential mate and a potential mating location we can continue with the final mating protocol. This is done by checking if the current organism's {\it Stomach} attribute is equal or higher than the amount of its {\it MinStomachRep} attribute. If this is also the case it means there is a potential mate who is enough fed, a cell within the neighborhood that can be replaced by an offspring and the current organism is fed enough to reproduce. For a final test we generate a random number between 0 and 1. Reproduction is only possible if this random number is smaller than the {\it ReproductionProbability} attribute of the organism type. This simulates natures success rate of giving birth. Having a reproduction probability of 1 would result in 100 $\%$ success rate given the previous conditions are met. When the two organisms successfully reproduce the stomach of the offspring is set to the average of its parents plus 1. This reflects natures way of being disabling two underfed parents to reproduce a well-fed child and therefore creating already eaten food. In addition the two parents both lose 1 stomach point in order to keep reproduction to a limit. This should simulate the increase of life difficulty of an organism once it has produced an offspring. Reproduction is natural, but it also hinders the parent's flexibility in life. Subtracting one stomach point enforces this concept, since the organism must now work harder (eat more) in order to stay alive.

 
\subsection{Neighbourhood}
\label{sec:neighbourhood}
As in game of life we inspect our neighborhood, see what kind of cells we find and act accordingly. 
We started off with the standard Moore-neighborhood and started testing the results of extending this neighborhood. This extension allows an organism to "see" further in the map and therefore not only eat more but reproduce with organism further away. Effects of this are discussed in section \ref{sec:DiscNeighbourhood}

\subsection{Death Causes}
In our model there are multiple ways a single organism can cease to exist. Depending on the cause the resulting cell differs too. Table \ref{tab:deathCauses} shows all possible death causes.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|p{11cm}}
Death Cause & Description \\ 
\hline 
\hline 
Age & At each time-step a random number between 0 and 1 is generated. If this number is smaller than the specified death probability the organism dies of age and the cell is turned into the type that is set in its {\it Becomes} attribute\\ 
\hline 
Hunger & When an organism's stomach reaches a negative number it dies of hunger and the cell is turned into the type that is set in its {\it Becomes} attribute\\ 
\hline 
Eaten & An organism can be eaten by its predator (or multiple predators in one time-step). If this is the case the cell becomes Nothing after the time-step is completed. We chose not to let the cell become the type that is set in its {\it Becomes} attribute because after being eaten an organism mainly resides in the stomach of its predator and does not contribute to the outside land anymore\\  
\end{tabular}
\caption{All death causes considered in our model.}
\label{tab:deathCauses}
\end{table}

\subsection{Known limits}
\label{sec:knownLimits}
Our model has certain limits due to abstraction of the concept. One major limit is the inability to move. In nature a herd of antelopes would escape the danger if detected. Since our organisms are unable switch places with another cell, the only way to move is by producing an offspring in a cell within the neighborhood. This of course requires a second organism of the same type. Thus, a single organism is unable to move while multiple organisms may create the illusion of moving. This does not differ much from Conway's Game of Life, where cells are also unable to move but patterns (such as a "glider" XXXXCITEXXXX) create the visual illusion that it is moving across the land.
\section{Implementation}
We used Matlab to create our simulation and an X-by-Y-by-12 sized matrix to store the data where X and Y correspond to the size of the map (Discussion about map sizes in section \ref{sec:mapDiscussion}. Having a 3D matrix allowed us to keep multiple attributes for each cell. Each layer of the 3d Matrix corresponds to one of the 12 attributes. For visual representation we used the following four subplots:
\begin{itemize}
\item A color coded 2d matrix of the current land. This was obtained by taking the matrix at level 1 of the 3d matrix, which shows the type of organism for each location on the land
\item A stacked bar plot to show the amount of deaths for each organism and the cause thereof.
\item  A second stacked bar plot showing the previous stacked bar plot with normalized numbers. This gives a better view of the percentages of each death cause for each organism. 
\item A line plot with a line for each of the 3 organisms (Grass, Antelope, Lion). The x-axis represents the time where the unit is "timestep" and the y-axis represents the quantity of the organism. This graph shows the current population on the land.
\end{itemize}
The final plot is shown in figure \ref{fig:plotScreenshot}.

\end{figure}


\section{Lotka Volterra}
The population of different organisms has been thoroughly studied. A.J. Lotka and V. Volterra found formulas describing the population number of two species, \cite{lotka}, \cite{volterra}. One species is a predator and the other species is the prey. A large number of predators results in a decrease of prey organisms, a small number of predators allows prey organisms to increase in number. On the other hand, the predators are fed by the prey, so predators only flourish when there are enough prey organisms to eat. When the number of prey organism becomes too little, predators die of hunger. These rules are reflected in the formulas of Lotka and Volterra, \cite{lotkaVolterra} which show the dynamics of the population.\\

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dx}{dt} = ax-bxy \\ 
\frac{dy}{dt} = cxy-dy
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The reasoning about the population count of organisms has been extended to three species, \cite{lotkaVolterraThreeSpecies}. The three organisms form a food chain. In the model, organisms Z are predators of organisms Y and organisms Y prey on organisms X. Therefore, compared to the two species situation, the population count of organism Y now additionally depends on the number predators (organisms Z).
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dx}{dt} = ax-bxy \\ 
\frac{dy}{dt} = -cy+dxy-eyz \\ 
\frac{dz}{dt} = -fz+gyz
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The resulting curves can be parametrized by the six constants a,b,c,d,e,f, and g as shown in Table \ref{tab:LotkaVolterraParameters}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Parameter & Description \\ 
\hline 
\hline 
a & reproduction rate of organisms X\\ 
\hline 
b & disadvantage of organisms X of being hunted\\ 
\hline 
c & vulnerability of organisms Y to overpopulation\\  
\hline 
d & advantage of organisms Y of hunting\\
\hline 
e & disadvantage of organisms Y of being hunted\\
\hline 
f & vulnerability of organisms Z to overpopulation\\
\hline 
g & advantage of organisms Z of hunting\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{The semantic meaning of the different constants.}
\label{tab:LotkaVolterraParameters}
\end{table}
This model could be further generalized in a similar manner to model $n$ organisms. The behaviour of the population curves highly depends on the choice of variables and is thoroughly studied in \cite{lotkaVolterraThreeSpecies}. The variable assignment $a=b=c=d=e=f=g=1$ results in oscillating population count curves shown in Figure \ref{fig:LotkaVolterraThreeAllOnes}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{LotkaVolterraThreeAllOnes.eps}
\caption{Lotka-Volterra equations for $a=b=c=d=e=f=g=1,start_X=0,5, start_Y=1,$ and $start_Z=2$.}
\label{fig:LotkaVolterraThreeAllOnes}
\end{figure}

\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
Running multiple simulations and adjusting the parameters and initial map there were several dependencies we discovered. Additionally we compared the population results obtained form the simulation with the Lotka-Volterra population curves for three species, \cite{lotkaVolterraThreeSpecies}. 

\subsection{Chosen Parameters}
A possibility of a simple parameter combination that produces a stable or oscillating population is given in table \ref{tab:ChosenParameters}.
The death probability was calculated using the helper function $deathProb(a) = 1-(\frac{a}{a+1})$ which takes input $a$ = average life expectancy and outputs the corresponding death probability.\\
We have decided to NOT let antelopes become grass when they die of age or hunger but rather become nothing. Reason for this is the dedication to a {\it Circle} of life. Antelopes get eaten by lions which become grass after they die which can then again be eaten by the antelopes. If antelopes were to become grass too after passing away there would be an additional arrow from antelope to grass. For the purpose of our model we decided against this addition.

\subsection{General Observations}
Our simulation is based on a set of inherently local rules. Two organisms only influence each other when both are in each others neighborbood. Therefore, the fastest possible propagation speed is once the radius of the neighborhood per time-step. However, structures larger than the one neighborhood can emerge over time when the influence spreads across the land. These macro phenomena seem to obey their own set of rules even if they are only the interaction between many cells. 
%Outline
In this section we introduce the patterns encountered during the simulations and explain why they naturally emerge.

\subsubsection{Oscillating or Stable population}
What is oscillating, what is stable...

Oscillation sometimes gets a semi-stable state and starts oscillating again.
Populations tend to oscillate because the different species depend on each other. Lions need to eat antelopes, antelopes need to eat grass and grass needs to have space to grow or be created because by the death of a lion. Therefore, less grass implies a decrease in the antelope population, which in turn implies a large number of dying lions and thus, an increase in the number of cells populated by grass. since there are few antelopes and lions, the grass has enough space to grow. at some point the antelope population starts to grow again since there is no longer too little grass available. The resulting reduction in the grass population starts a new oscillation cycle and the many antelopes enable a larger lion population.\\



\subsubsection{Patterns}
Balance out at beginning. Because of random
Oscillation. Stable.

As in Conway's Game of Life we detected certain patterns. "Island of lion", "Chased antilope herd"

The organisms need to form groups in order to survive as a species. This is needed because all organisms can only reproduce if there is at least one other organism of the same species in its neighborhood.

\subsubsection{Location Dependency}
Die because of location and inability to move
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:knownLimits}...
Location of animals have impact on survival, not only numbers


\subsubsection{Random Selection vs Sequential Selection}
Neighbor selection to make sure not the top left neighbor will have offspring.
Cell selection because patterns tend to have one direction.

\subsubsection{Map Size}
\label{sec:mapDiscussion}
Patterns remain the same (except if we change the neighborhood). Small map is more likely to fall apart.Size of "Wipeouts" is fix. Wipeout = one organism takes over. Small map oscillates more and will become unstable quicker. On large map multiple wipeouts can equalize each other.
Large map equals stable non-oscillating cycle. 

In larger lands oscillating structures have a fixed size. Therefore, a larger land contains more oscillating structures that do not need to be in the same state because our model only considers local neighborhoods. The phase shift between the oscillating structures evens out the overall population counts. Therefore, the population curves for larger lands tend to stabilize close to an equilibrium where as lands with a size small enough to fit only one or few oscillating structures show a clear oscillation. Lands that are too small to fit an oscillating structure show an extinction of a race or result in a complete wipeout.\\

Islands of Lions. Large Map results smaller probability of this happening.

\subsubsection{Neighborhood Size}
\label{sec:DiscNeighbourhood}
See further. Eat more
An increase in the considered neighborhood enlarges the oscillating structures.



\subsubsection{Removal of one species}
When our Model is started without any grass, then the population still behaves the same as if grass was added at the beginning, because once a lion dies, it becomes grass. Therefore, the antelopes can potentially reach grass, survive and keep up the balance. However, since the antelopes need to go pass the lions to reach grass it is rather unlikely that lions and antelopes survive. The smaller the land is the smaller the probability that the land recovers from the initially strongly unbalanced situation.
When no antelopes are added in the beginning, all lions starve for sure, because thy cannot reach there prey. The grass population then fills the entire land and hits a hard limit, because there are no more cells to populate. 
If initially no lions are added to the land there are two different outcomes: Either the antelopes eat all the grass and then starve leaving an extinct land, or the both organisms survive. The latter case is more probable in larger lands, whereas in smaller lands the population seldom remains stable.

Removing one of the species impacts the population curves in the following way: Figure \ref{fig:removingOneOrganism}. In the Lotka-Volterra model removing all grass leads to the extinction of all organisms, because all antelopes starve and therefore, also all lions die of hunger.
When there are no antelopes, the food chain is broken and all the lions starve. The grass can flourish because it has no natural enemies. Therefore the grass population grows indefinitely. However, removing only the lions simply reduces the Lotka-Volterra model for three species to the model with only 2 species and thus, the population of the grass and of the antelopes are self regulating and the curves oscillate.

For the our model the situation is different in some ways, because we consider locations and neighborhoods rather than only advancing based on pure population count. Additionally the size of our land is limited to a fixed number of cells. Therefore a indefinite population growth cannot occur in our model.

\section{Summary and Outlook}

Adjusting the parameters in the Lotka-Volterra formulas to the values shown in Table \ref{tab:LotkaVolterraParametersFinal} results in  population curves similar to the ones obtained from our simulation. Therefore, we conclude that our simulation models the habitat of organisms is somewhat consistent to the Lotka-Volterra equations for the situation that all three species are present.


Answer questions
Location of animals important. It is not taken into account by lotka-volterra.

Dependent of each other. 
Only antelopes and grass causes wipeout. with larger lands most of the time stable
