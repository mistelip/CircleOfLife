\section{Description of the Model}

\subsection{Distinction from Game of Life}
Instead of having simple cells that can either be dead or alive, the cells in our system contain organisms parametrizable using different attributes. Table \ref{tab:Properties} lists all attributes and describes their meaning.

\begin{tabular}{l|l}\label{tab:Properties}
Name & Description\\
\hline 
\hline 
Type & "Lion", "Antilope", "Grass" or "Nothing" \\ 
\hline 
PreyType & Type of the organism to prey \\ 
\hline 
Becomes & Type to become after a natural death \\ 
\hline 
FoodDigest & Amount of food digested in one day \\ 
\hline 
Stomach & Amount of food in organism \\ 
\hline 
MaxStomach & Maximal amount of food organism can contain \\ 
\hline 
DeathProb & The probability to die at the end of the day \\ 
\hline 
Fatness & The number of predator that can be fed eating the organism \\ 
\hline
Alive & 1 if alive, 0 if bitten\\
\hline 
MinStomachRepInd & Minimal amount of food needed to reproduce \\  
\hline 
RepProb & Probability to reproduce when possible\\
\hline 
IsOffspring & 1 if newborn, 0 if adult\\
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l|l}\label{tab:deathCauses}
Death Cause & Description \\ 
\hline 
\hline 
Age & The DeathProb determines if an organism dies of age at the end of each day\\ 
\hline 
Hunger & An organism with an empty stomach dies of hunger \\ 
\hline 
Eaten & Prey dies at the end of the day if bitten by predator \\  
\end{tabular} 

\section{Implementation}
We implemented a cell based system that simulates the habitat of three different species.
We compared the population results obtained form the simulation with the Lotka Volterra population curves for three species, \cite{lotkaVolterraThreeSpecies}. The results of this comparison enabled us to gain better understanding of the equilibria and the oscillating behaviour of the different populations in our simulation.
