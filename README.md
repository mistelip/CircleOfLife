> * Group Name: Children Of Scar
> * Group participants names: Kaelin Ruben, Misteli Patrick
> * Project Title: Circle Of Life

## General Introduction
(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)


Balance of Nature
Exitential Theory
Wildlife Modeling
Darwin's Theories
Animal Life Cicle
Con. Game Of Life 
#Note the Lenghts

## The Model
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)

Game of life




## Fundamental Questions
(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

Balance of Nature?
Importance of parameters



## Expected Results
(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

Balanced
Lotka-Volterra
